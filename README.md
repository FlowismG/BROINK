## What is this?
This is a simple competitive player vs player game. It is designed to be well suited for machine learning experiments, but it's also just a fun game.

## Can I use this?
Yes, it's puplished as CreativeCommons0 so you can modify and use it commercially without giving credit. See full license attached.

## Game Maker Version
This game was created using GameMaker IDE v2022.8.1.37 and Runtime v2022.8.1.53 but it should open up perfectly fine in any version newer than that as well.

## What to do with this?
Eyy, I don't have time to work on this any further, which is a lil sad cause I think it's quite classy and has lots of potential, so if you'd like to publish this on Steam or port it to mobile and publish it on the app store, give it a go! Feel free to add new game meachnics, or if you are into that, start your onw machine learning experiments. Can you make an AI that bats mine? The sky is the limit. Have fun! :)
