The original, and this fork, are licensed <b> under absolutely nothing. </b> Have fun and abuse this for your own pleasures if you so desire.

Jonas content released his work completely to the public without conservative, territorial, and possessive need to claim some sort of stake in it. He did not need thousands of cleverly written loophole-"some rights reserved" licenses, nor did he need to debate about the superiority of any of them, rather, he tossed the entire equation out the window and render it effectively useless. He fully realises that a man in El Salvador could profit wildly from his efforts and gain the millions of dollars he never did, and could theoretically hunt down every copy and burn it, leaving him as the sole distributor; however, this does not offend him, rather, he allows all to be shared, taking the risk and fully knowing the potential repercussions, rather than let the menace that is copyright conquer yet another soul. 

And due to that, here I am with this fork. 
I still don't know what to do with this however

## Game Maker Version
This game was created using GameMaker IDE v2022.8.1.37 and Runtime v2022.8.1.53 but it should open up perfectly fine in any version newer than that as well.

## What to do with this?
fork it even further??? idk
